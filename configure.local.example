# For all settings documented in this file, there are reasonable
# defaults and/or the ./configure script attempts autodetection.
# Consequently, you only need to create a file ./configure.local
# and put any of these settings into it if ./configure autodetection
# fails or if you want to make different choices for other reasons.
# If autodetection fails, please tell <hans@stare.cz>

# We recommend that you write ./configure.local from scratch and
# only put the lines there you need.  This file contains examples.
# It is not intended as a template to be copied as a whole.

# --- user settings relevant for all builds ----------------------------

# The following installation directories are used.
# It is possible to set only one or a few of these variables,
# there is no need to copy the whole block.
# Even if you set PREFIX to something else, the other variables
# pick it up without copying them all over.

PREFIX="${HOME}"
BINDIR="${PREFIX}/bin"
MANDIR="${PREFIX}/man"
INSTALL="install"


# --- settings that rarely need to be touched --------------------------

# You can manually override the compiler to be used.
# But that's rarely useful because ./configure asks your make(1)
# which compiler to use, and that answer will hardly be wrong.

CC=cc

# The default compiler flags are:

CFLAGS="-g -W -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -Wno-unused-parameter -Wwrite-strings"

# In rare cases, it may be required to skip individual automatic tests.
# Each of the following variables can be set to 0 (test will not be run
# and will be regarded as failed) or 1 (test will not be run and will
# be regarded as successful).

HAVE_ERR=0
HAVE_PROGNAME=0
HAVE_STRTONUM=0
#HAVE_REALLOCARRAY=0
